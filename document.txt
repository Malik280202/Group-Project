There is the Online Magaine Projet that Has been built by Team Gamer ("Abdumalik", "Raj", "Koruna", "Jivan", "Azizah"). We decided  to choose this topic
because in the current days despite the popularity of the gaming industry There is no worth magazine about Gaming content.So we decided to create one.


Design of the Magazine has been mutually choosen by our group we decided to use pixel font because we thought this is the most suitable for gaming content.However
reading pixel style font can be difficult to read for someone but as mainly  gamers are younger generation we think the will not have a problem to read it.


Html part has been built by Malik and Raj, while Style.css was Girls duty. Jivan actively participated on finding informations and related topics.
When it comes to color mixtures it is a bit unusuall but as it can be seen on style we mainly focused on CyberPunk style.

As example we choosed online option of VOGUE fashion Magazine.

During the creation of the  website we faced problem of font-weight becuase we tried to make pixel style a bit readable.
Secondly footer section was problem too.Becuase Animations of footers was a bit difficult to code.

Advantages of this assigmnt was huge experience of coding in the group.We learnt how to code 3 to 4 people simultaneously.We find an extension such as Code together which allow us to code with our friends
